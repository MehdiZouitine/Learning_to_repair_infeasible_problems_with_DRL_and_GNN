This repository contains the official code and resources for the paper **"Learning to Repair Infeasible∗ Problems with Deep Reinforcement Learning on Graphs"**, presented at LION 19.

## Overview

## Abstract

This work explores infeasible problems. It focuses on using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) not to solve a given problem, but to repair infeasible problem instances. Indeed, some constraint problems can become infeasible due to contradictory or inconsistent constraints. We use bipartite graph neural networks to represent the interactions among these inconsistent constraints. We use deep reinforcement learning, which is used to directly and automatically develop effective repair heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first step toward the automated analysis of infeasibility and the systematic repair of problematic instances from a DRL perspective.


## Key Contributions

## Contribution

- We formalize the repair of an infeasible Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
- We encode Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) as bipartite graphs and use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of the constraints within a CSP.
- We use a DRL algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to learn a repair policy in both linear and Boolean domains.
